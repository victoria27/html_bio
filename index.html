<h1>Hello!</h1>

<a href="about.html">About Me</a>

<p>Welcome to my page and get to know a little more about me and my hobbies. I have always been a dedicated artist and would draw every day at the age of seven. When I got older, I decided to attend the art institute to continue my passion. While I was in school, I decided to a class in web design. I began to get more interested in programming after I graduated. If you want to know more about me. Click on my about me link.</p>
